# QuartTools - What it is?
We developers are lazy so I made some tools for easier life on internet. They are adding you some functions and custom themes for websites like YouTube, Instagram, etc.  
This is an extension for `Chrome`, `Edge`. It's free to use for everyone, so feel free to download :)  
[Chrome Webstore](https://quartyn.ml/tools?utm_source=github&q_content=readme)

## Can I contribute?
Yes! Of course you can. You can find some themes in [this directory](/design/themes/) and you can submit some theme for web you'd like to. ðŸ˜Š  
You'll get a badge `Contributor` on your `QuartTools` account (same account as [Quartyn's Services](https://quartyn.ml/account/)) and your name will also be in that CSS file.  
I am very grateful for every contribution you make.

## Hmm, can I request Theme?
```Oh god.. I'm really bad at CSS..```   
No worry! You can also request theme for website you want. You need to go to `Themes` tab in QuartTools and on right up click "Request Theme" > "Request New Theme"

## Can I change app language?
Well.. for now there is only English language.. BUT I will add this in coming updates.. and you will be able to contribute with your own translation in your native language. Sounds awesome right?

## What are Ranks?
For every contribution, feedback, report, suggestion you receive points based on how valuable that contribution was.   
Based on points, you'll also get some Badge.. `Noobie`, `Golden`, `Skilled`, `Professional`, `Extreme God!`, `Quartyn's Teammate` :D

### Oh god, I found broken theme. What can I do?
If you found some bug or any type of error in QuartTools Themes, you can submit a feedback in `Feedback` tab in QuartTools Overlay.   
```I sent a bug report in feedback and after long time theme is still not fixed!```    
It is possible that your feedback was not sent properly and somewhere it disappeared ðŸ˜¢. But don't worry, if you want to, you can still send email to me with that bug described. In that email, please in email object write something like `Theme Bug - instagram.com` and in body write your QuartTools username (#id also if you want to) and message if you have something more to say.   
You can send theme bugs and errors on [this email](themes@quartyn.ml)
